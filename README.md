# FS-Jump-Rotation-Analysis

**Jump in Figure Skating: AI-Driven Rotation Analysis**

A deep learning-based system for automatically detecting under-rotations in figure skating jumps using motion data extracted from video.

## ⛸️ Overview

In figure skating competitions, judging accuracy and fairness are essential but often limited by human perception. One of the most common judging errors arises from under-rotations—cases where a skater's jump rotation is slightly insufficient upon landing. Detecting such under-rotations by eye is difficult, particularly in fast multi-rotation jumps and when camera angles change.

This project aims to build a deep learning-based system that can automatically determine whether a jump is under-rotated using motion data extracted from video. The system provides:

1. A transparent, physics-consistent method of evaluating jump rotation
2. Reduced bias introduced by human judgment
3. Potential use as a tool to assist technical specialists in real-time scoring or post-event video review

## 📝 Dataset

The project uses the "Figure Skating Under-rotations and Flutz/Lip" dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sarazany/figure-skating-underrotations-and-flutzlip/data).

The dataset consists of short video clips from international figure skating competitions, categorized by:
- **Full rotation**: Complete jump rotations
- **Under-rotation**: Insufficient rotations (our focus)
- **Questionable (q)**: Borderline cases
- **Downgraded (down)**: Severely under-rotated

## 🔬 Methodology

1. **Pose Extraction**: MediaPipe Pose extracts 33 keypoints per frame
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalization and temporal alignment
3. **Model Architecture**: TCN with dilated convolutions for temporal pattern recognition
4. **Training**: Cross-entropy loss with class weights, AdamW optimizer
5. **Evaluation**: Multiple metrics including accuracy, F1-score, recall, and ROC-AUC
